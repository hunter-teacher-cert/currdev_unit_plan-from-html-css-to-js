# Homework: Guessing game
Create a guessing game where you pose a question in the console and students have to guess the answer. This can be a riddle, a review question for any class, or trivia.
Use the code we used in class as a template.

*Possible answer:*
```
var answerCheck="";
var userInput = window.prompt("What is black and white, and read all over?");

if ((userInput==null)||(userInput=="")){
  answerCheck="<h1>Nothing was entered. Refresh the page and try again.</h1>";
} else if (userInput=="newspaper") {
  answerCheck="<h1>You are correct!</h1>";
} else{
  answerCheck="<h1>Wrong! The answer is newspaper!</h1>";
}
document.write(answerCheck);
```
