# Lab 9- intro to JS
Welcome to JS! The last language you will learn about (we hope) will deal with manipulating both HTML and CSS to add more interactivity to your website. Let's start with the basics: variables. Just like math, variables are used to store or hold onto a value. While in math you don't always know what the value is, in coding you get to assign that value!


## Instructions
Let's create a birthday calculator! Follow the steps in class (or below) to complete this lab.

1. Create a few variables in the script.js using var:
    * var birthYear = your birth year;
    * var toYear = this year;
    * var age = toYear-birthYear;
2. Let's print it out!:
    * console.log("You are about" + age + "years old!");
3. Let's look at the console! Notice how close together the number is to the words? Let's add some space after "about" and before "years".
