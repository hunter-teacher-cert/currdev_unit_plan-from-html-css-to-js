# Lab 10- Practice Conditionals!
A few things have been set up for you in this lab that we will go over later in the semester, but for now, we will focus on conditional statements.

Conditional statements will also be called if statements. They help with cause and effect so that an action must meet speficic guidelines before it can be deployed. For example(peep the formatting!):
```
  if (I do my homework){
    I will pass my class;
  }
```
You can add more if statements by using "else if" as follows:
```
  if (I do my homework){
    I will pass my class;
  } else if (I study for my exam){
    I will pass the exam;
  }
```
You can also add "else" at the end for circumstances not covered in the if statement(s):
```
  if (I do my homework){ 
    I will pass my class;
  } else if (I study for my exam){
    I will pass the exam;
  } else {
    I will fail;
  }
```
* NOTE: Indentation is important when using conditionals.

## Task
We will work on this in class together, but essentially we will check to see if we can guess the machine's random number generator.

1. Let's enter a guess number on line 7 in the script. Choose one between 0 and 10!
2. Next we need to set up conditions. We should check if the number is too high, too low, or just right!
3. Lastly, open up the console on the right and click Run to test it out!
