# Lesson 1- Intro to Javascript
## Time- 1 session, 45 mins

## Objectives(SWBAT)
  * identify and explore different uses for JS
  * reflect on past projects and how we can improve them

## Standards
* 9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.

## Vocabulary
  * javascript, console
  
## Materials
  * laptop, slides(01_intro to js), sample websites (on slides)

## Lesson Context
* Before lesson- finished CS lesson
* Next lesson- intro to variables

## Lesson Sequence
### Do Now:
Students will reflect on previous projects to see what functional additions they would add.
### Lesson:
We will review the definition of Javascript and go over samples of code both from my own library of projects and from past student work. Students will also get to demo games and other interactive parts of projects. We will inspect projects to peak into code and see how all 3 languages(HTML, CSS, and JS) work together.
### Student Activity/Exit Slip:
Students will reflect on the lesson and further add more functional and interactive ways they could improve on projects.

## Differentiation
### Scaffolds/Support:
We will look at a variety of easy, medium, and high level projects. Looking at the console allows students to see parts of projects we already know how to do and allows students who are higher level to see future possibilities in code.

## Interdisciplinary connections
* engineering
* computer science
* front- and back-end coding
* game design
