# Lab - intro to JS
Welcome to JS! The last language you will learn about (we hope) will deal with manipulating both HTML and CSS to add more interactivity to your website. Let's start with the basics: variables. Just like math, variables are used to store or hold onto a value. While in math you don't always know what the value is, in coding you get to assign that value!


## Instructions
Let's create a birthday calculator! Follow the steps in class (or below) to complete this lab.

1. Create a few variables in the script.js using var:
    * birthYear = your birth year;
    * toYear = this year;
    * age = toYear-birthYear;
2. Let's print it out!:
    * console.log("You are about" + age + "years old!");
3. Notice how close together the number is to the words? Let's add some space after about and before years in the console.


CODE ANSWER
```
console.log("Hello");
birthYear= 2005;
toYear= 2021;
age= toYear-birthYear;
console.log("You are about "+ age + " years old!");
```
Output: You are about 16 years old!
