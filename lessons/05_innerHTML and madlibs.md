# Lesson 5- innerHTML
## Time- 1 session, 45 mins

## Objectives
* learn the differences between prompt and innerHTML
* learn to select elements, IDs, or classes in JS
* practie both innerHTML and prompt
* differentiate between div and span

## Standards
* 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.

## Vocabulary
  * innerHTML, document.querySelector(), span
  
## Materials
  * slides(05_js innerHTML.pdf), code(05_innerHTML and madlibs.html), repl account

## Lesson Context
* Before lesson- review prompt and strings in response validation and case sensitivity
* Next lesson- learn inputs and events

## Lesson Sequence
### Do Now: 
Review case-sensitivity and brief check for understanding about the difference between a number variable and a number string
### Lesson:
Inroduce innerHTML and review the differences between them. To further introduce innerHTML, we look at examples from a previous JS example we saw in lesson 1. Explain how HTML components can be manipulated using document.querySelector(). I break the word down so it seems less intimidating and so they understand that code, in essence, is still the English language. Explain span and how it will be used in today's code.

### Student Activity/Exit Slip:
Students will code-along a game of madlibs. We will go through the lab step by step. We set up the window.prompt at the beginning, store user inputs into variables for nouns and adjectives, grab the IDs from span using document.querySelector(), and use innerHTML to submit each user input into the correct spots in our code.

## Differentiation
### Scaffolds/Support
Steps are laid out for students throughout the code. Students are encouraged to use their resources if they need help. I will display my board in large text and walk around the room at each step to make sure students understand the task. Since this is a code-along, students are expected to have the same if not similar code to mine, which is projected on the board.
