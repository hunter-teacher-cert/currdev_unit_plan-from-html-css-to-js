# Lesson 2- Intro to variables
## Time- 1 session, 45 mins

## Objectives
  * understand variables in different contexts and their many uses
  * practice using variables through code and the console

## Standards
* 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.

## Vocabulary
  * variable, window prompt, command prompt, string, boolean, assignment, storing, var, algorithm, console
  
## Materials
  * slides(02_js variables.pdf), code(02_intro to variables.js), laptop, repl account, case-sensitive

## Lesson Context
* Before lesson- explore different JS sample projects
* Next lesson- use variables in conditional statements

## Lesson Sequence
### Do Now: 
Students will write specific instructions on how to make a sandwhich with a few listed ingredients. This is just a fun and short review on algorithms and the importance of specific language and careful planning of code.
### Lesson:
Types of variables reviewed, followed by how to use them in different examples. I also make a point to explain case-sensitive and proper syntax with both variables and other JS components. Afterwards we look at how to use JS as a seperate sheet from HTML. Explain that things printed in the console do not appear physically on the website.
### Student Activity/Exit Slip:
The first lab for this unit is a code-along. We go over some basic JS rules, such as declaring variables, using semi-colons at the ends of statements, and making sure that things follow a specific order. We code our birthdays and show that we can use a combination of sentences and variables to print out a statement in the console.

## Differentiation
### Scaffolds/Support
Students are encouraged to use their resources if they need help. I will display my board in large text and walk around the room at each step to make sure students understand the task. Since this is a code-along, students are expected to have the same if not similar code to mine, which is projected on the board.
