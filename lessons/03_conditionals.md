# Lesson 3- Variables and Conditional Statements
## Time- 1 session, 45 mins

## Objectives
* discuss real-world examples of conditional statements as it relates to life and/or code
* review conditionals in relation to variables

## Standards
* 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.

## Vocabulary
  * conditional statements, operator
  
## Materials
  * slides (03_js conditionals.pdf), code(03_intro to conditionals.js)

## Lesson Context
* Before lesson- learn about variables
* Next lesson- use variables, conditional statements, and command prompt to play a guessing game

## Lesson Sequence
### Do Now:
Review the different types of variables we learned the day before. Today we will be using numbers.
### Lesson:
We review conditional statements and its importance in code and in our lives. Most things goes through a condition in order for a something to happen. Then we look at some coding examples and basic syntax. I also explain the differences between the = and == operators in code.
### Student Activity/Exit Slip:
We do a code-along in this lab with a random number guesser. The random number generator is already included in the lab. The way the lab is set up, students only get one change to get the answer correct. This is intentional, since I intend to revisit this example in a future unit. I guide students through the lab asking questions like "How do we win the game? What are the conditions to win? What if my guess is too low? Which operator is to be used in the conditions and why?"

## Differentiation
### Scaffolds/Support
Guided questions will help students with filling out the lab. I will display the code on the board in large text to ensure students can see it. Students are encouraged to talk to their neighbor or use our resources if they get stuck on the lab.

## Interdisciplinary connections
* life, product design
