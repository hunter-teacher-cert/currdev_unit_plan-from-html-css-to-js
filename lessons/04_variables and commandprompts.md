# Lesson 4- Command prompt and user input
## Time- 1 session, 45 mins 

## Objectives
* review different kinds of operators
* learn to check variables for case-sensitivity
* understand uses of String variables

## Standards
* 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.
* 9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.

## Vocabulary
  * case-sensitivity, window.prompt(), document.write(),
  
## Materials
  * slides (04_js variables and window prompt.pdf), code(04_strings and commandprompts.js), HW(04_HW.md), repl account

## Lesson Context
* Before lesson- how to use conditional statements
* Next lesson- using innerHTML to code madlibs

## Lesson Sequence
### Do Now: 
Review conditional statements in preparation for today's activity
### Lesson:
Review case-sensitivity with students; prompt them for examples before showing them the list of examples. Afterwards we look at examples of case-sensitivity in code.
### Student Activity/Exit Slip:
In the lab, we look at command/window prompt to create a response validation. We use conditionals to check if what someone inputs in their code is the correct answer to a question. We get to explore inputting informaion onto a webste using document.write(). We only go over guessing one of 5 boroughs since we plan to revisit this lab in a later unit.
### Homework
Students will create a game of their own using the window prompt (for example: typing in the answer to a riddle).

## Differentiation
### Scaffolds/Support
Students are encouraged to use their resources if they need help. I will display my board in large text and walk around the room at each step to make sure students understand the task. Since this is a code-along, students are expected to have the same if not similar code to mine, which is projected on the board.
