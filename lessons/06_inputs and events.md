## Lesson Sequence
### Do Now: 
Students are prompted to create a list of user inputs they are familiar with. We will focus on computer inputs versus ones done on a celular device or other tech/nontech inputs.
### Lesson:
After we review 3 categories of inputs(mouse, keyboard, touch), we learn about 2 ways to code input in HTML (button and input). Next we learn about adding event listeners to inputs in order to
