# Lesson 6- Inputs and events
## Time- 1 session, 45 mins

## Objectives
* code user input
* adding event listeners to code
* create a dummy login page

## Standards
* 9-12.IC.4: Assess personal and societal trade-offs related to computing technologies and data privacy.
* 9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.
* 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.
* 9-12.CY.1: Determine the types of personal and organizational information and digital resources that an individual may have access to that needs to be protected.
* 9-12.CY.2: Describe physical, digital, and behavioral safeguards that can be employed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of information.

## Vocabulary
  * input, .addEventListener(), nested
  
## Materials
  * slides(06_js inputs and events.pdf), code(06_inputs and events.js and html), repl account

## Lesson Context
* Before lesson- innerHTML and madlibs
* Next lesson- project ideation

## Lesson Sequence
### Do Now: 
Students are prompted to create a list of user inputs they are familiar with. We will focus on computer inputs versus ones done on a celular device or other tech/nontech inputs.
### Lesson:
After we review 3 categories of inputs(mouse, keyboard, touch), we learn about 2 ways to code input in HTML (button and input). Next we learn about adding event listeners to inputs in order to make the inputs work. I break down every section of the event listener so it's less intimidating and they understand that code is just the English language. We look at some sample conditional statements that can be used with event listeners and look at a nested conditional statement. We also introduce another form of response validation by using a numeric variable to count the number of wrong tries.
In addition to the lesson, we also review passwords (such as case-sensitivity) and the importance of proper password security(like using something not easy to guess, like avoiding using the username as part of the password).
### Student Activity/Exit Slip:
Students code-along to the lab. I ask them to find and input the IDs from the HTML and input them into variables. We review them as a class and make sure that spelling and casing is correct. Afterwards, we set up the event listener and conditions of the pasword checker.

## Differentiation
### Scaffolds/Support
Steps are laid out for students throughout the code. Students are encouraged to use their resources if they need help. I will display my board in large text and walk around the room at each step to make sure students understand the task. Since this is a code-along, students are expected to have the same if not similar code to mine, which is projected on the board.
