# Lesson 7- Final Project
## Time- 5 sessions, 45 mins each

## Objectives
* explore possible projects to tackle for their final project
* create an interative and fun project with a partner
* use resources and prior knowledge to create a game in HTML, CSS, and Javascript

## Standards
* 9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.
* 9-12.IC.6: Create accessible computational artifacts that meet standard compliance requirements or otherwise meet the needs of users with disabilities.
* 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.
* 7-8.CT.7: Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information.
* 9-12.CT.9: Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.
* 9-12.DL.2: Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

## Vocabulary
  * project ideation
  
## Materials
  * slides (07_js final project.pdf), repl account, project ideation form(JS Project- Ideation.pdf)

## Lesson Sequence
### Do Now:
Review of previous lesson
### Lesson:
* Day 1: Introduce project choices. Review project expectations. Commence project ideation with partners once they choose one of the 3 games (image guesser, quiz, hangman). Once worksheet is complete, we review each group and come up with solutions for possible problems.
* Day 2-3: Students start coding. They work on HTML and CSS portion of their project. Throughout the coding process, we may stop and debug as a class.
* Day 3-4: Students continue coding. They start working on the Javascript portion. Throughout the coding process, we may stop and debug as a class.
* Day 5: Presentations. Students get to present and try out their code with their classmates. We ask for volunteers to come up to the board and try them out.

## Differentiation
### Scaffolds/Support
All slides and coding materials are posted. Students are encouraged to look at these resources when coding, including looking at past assignments and using w3schools as a reference. Students will be working with a partner so they can debug together or ask for help from another group working on a similar project.
