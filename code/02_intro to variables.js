console.log("Hello");
// Let's practice making variables below!

// change birthYear to the year you were born
// change toYear to current year
var birthYear=???;
var toYear=???;
//Create a new variable called age to subtract both birthYear and toYear

// Add the variable age to the following console.log
console.log("You are" + ??? + "years old!");
