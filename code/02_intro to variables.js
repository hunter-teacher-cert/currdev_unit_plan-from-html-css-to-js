console.log("Hello");
// Let's practice making variables below!

// change birthYear to the year you were born
// change toYear to current year
var birthYear=???;
var toYear=???;
//Create a new variable called age to subtract both birthYear and toYear

// Add the variable age to the following console.log
console.log("You are" + ??? + "years old!");

// Homework for lesson 2, lab 2
// Now that we learned a little about creating variables, create a program in Javascript that converts a value from a variable
// from one measurement to another. Print this in the console in a sentence. Remember tat variables can do all kinds of calculations.
// Use the w3schools or our slides as a guide. Below is a list of examples:
//  * feet to inches
//  * Celcius to Farenheit or Kelvin
//  * meters to feet
