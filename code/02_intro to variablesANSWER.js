console.log("Hello");
// Let's practice making variables below!

// change birthYear to the year you were born
// change toYear to current year
var birthYear=2005;
var toYear=2021;
//Create a new variable called age to subtract both birthYear and toYear
var age= toYear-birthYear;

// Add the variable age to the following console.log
console.log("You are " + age + " years old!");
