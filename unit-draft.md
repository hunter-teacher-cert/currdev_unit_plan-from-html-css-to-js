Write a draft proposal for your unit plan.
Your unit plan draft proposal should have the following parts:
* High level description of unit content.
* Rationale for creating the unit.
* Placement of unit in existing class/sequence.

  I would like to create a unit plan for teaching Javascript. This unit will come after teaching HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This to me seems like a natural progression in the Web Design class that I currently teach. I want to teach students something that shouldn't take too long to learn and adds interactivity within the website. I have taught Javascript before in a one week intensive web design course, but I have yet to teach it within a semester. I am hoping to expand on the lessons that I already have, which isn't much since I did not get to teach them last school year.

  The first things I would teach besides the basics (like selecting ids and classes and assigning them a variable) are events and innerHTML. These 2 things would be a great introduction to interactivity for their websites. They can click or type things to make parts of the website appear or disappear. The first few lessons will be about selecting and storing ids and classes into variables; and modifying/adding/deleting ids and classes. These will be key in then understanding how events work and how we can use them in conjunction with innerHTML.
  
  The above would probably take up to 2 weeks to teach. I think that variables would take a few days and then we would work with a variety of events before finally covering innerHTML. I am unsure what the culminating project would be but I am hoping to do some research on some fun projects that students can create. I have purchased some JS books to see how I can teach these concepts.
