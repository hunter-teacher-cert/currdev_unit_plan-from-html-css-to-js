Write a draft proposal for your unit plan.
Your unit plan draft proposal should have the following parts:
* High level description of unit content.
* Rationale for creating the unit.
* Placement of unit in existing class/sequence.

  I would like to create a unit plan for teaching Javascript. This unit will come after teaching HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This to me seems like a natural progression in the Web Design class that I currently teach. I want to teach students something that shouldn't take too long to learn and adds interactivity within the website. I have taught Javascript before in a one week intensive web design course, but I have yet to teach it within a semester. I am hoping to expand on the lessons that I already have, which isn't much since I did not get to teach them last school year.

  The first things I would teach besides the basics (like selecting ids and classes and assigning them a variable) are events and innerHTML. These 2 things would be a great introduction to interactivity for their websites. They can click or type things to make parts of the website appear or disappear. The next topic I want to cover is the use of APIs. It is a difficult topic but I believe would be a great way to end the unit. Students can combine the use of innerHTML and APIs to make a searchable engine inside the website. These ideas are subject to change since I still need to do more research on exactly what I want to teach or include in the lessons.
  
  The above would probably take up to 2 weeks to teach. I think that events and innerHTML will only take a few days to go over. The majority of the time will be about learning how to navigate and connect APIs to a website. We would find a topic and build the website before tinkering with APIs. This planning may take a day or so, leaving hopefully 4 or 5 days to complete the rest of the work.
