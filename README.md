# Introduction to Javascript
by Daiana Munoz

-----

## General Overview
<!--(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)-->
Class: Digital Web Design
In this unit, students will learn the basics of Javascript and how it can be an interactive part of any website. This unit will follow the HTML and CSS units.
Students will learn about variables, DOM manipulation, and events. Culminating final project still TBD.

## Motivation for Unit
<!--(why have you decided to make this?)-->
Intro to Javascript will be the last unit in the Digital Web Design class taught at PEHS. JS is also a common language that front-end computer programmers use and students should learn what is standard in the CS industry.

## Standards Referenced
<!--(select one of the standards sets reviewed in class (CSTA, NY, MA, RI), include a link and a brief explanation as to why you selected that set)-->
* New York State Computer Science and Digital Fluency Learning Standards
The following sections from the above standards were used in this unit. I wanted to teach some basic Javascript related to HTML while also addressing some of the issues tied to the lesson topics.
### Topics addressed:
* 9-12.IC.4: Assess personal and societal trade-offs related to computing technologies and data privacy.
* 9-12.IC.6: Create accessible computational artifacts that meet standard compliance requirements or otherwise meet the needs of users with disabilities.
* 9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.
* 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.
* 7-8.CT.7: Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information.
* 9-12.CT.9: Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.
* 9-12.CT.10: Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.
* 9-12.CY.1: Determine the types of personal and organizational information and digital resources that an individual may have access to that needs to be protected.
* 9-12.DL.2: Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.
