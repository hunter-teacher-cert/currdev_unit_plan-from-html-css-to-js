# Introduction to Javascript
by Daiana Munoz

-----

## General Overview
<!--(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)-->
Class: Digital Web Design

In this unit, students will learn the basics of Javascript and how it can be an interactive part of any website. By now, students will have learned HTML and CSS 
and will use both langugages throughout the unit. Students will learn about variables, DOM manipulation, and events. Final project will be done in pairs and can choose to code either Hangman, an Image Guesser, or a Quiz with a score at the end.

## Motivation for Unit
<!--(why have you decided to make this?)-->
Intro to Javascript will be the last unit in the Digital Web Design class taught at PEHS. JS is also a common language that front-end computer programmers use and I believe students should learn what is standard in the CS industry.

## Standards Referenced
<!--(select one of the standards sets reviewed in class (CSTA, NY, MA, RI), include a link and a brief explanation as to why you selected that set)-->
[New York State Computer Science and Digital Fluency Learning Standards(NYSCSDFLS)](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-digital-fluency-standards-k-12.pdf): The following sections from the NYSCSDFLS were used in this unit. I wanted to teach some basic Javascript related to HTML while also addressing some of the issues tied to the lesson topics.

* 9-12.IC.4: Assess personal and societal trade-offs related to computing technologies and data privacy.
* 9-12.IC.6: Create accessible computational artifacts that meet standard compliance requirements or otherwise meet the needs of users with disabilities.
* 9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.
* 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.
* 7-8.CT.7: Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information.
* 9-12.CT.9: Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.
* 9-12.CT.10: Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.
* 9-12.CY.1: Determine the types of personal and organizational information and digital resources that an individual may have access to that needs to be protected.
* 9-12.DL.2: Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

## Tools Used
* HTML, CSS, and Javascript using Repl as the coding environment
* Google Classroom for access to the labs/assignments
  * Google Docs for planning their final project

---

## Resources
* [W3Schools](http://w3schools.com/)
* [Student Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Bj1zuknxTlWu1_b014lqL6UkduuS1iy1jdFcpv7hdYI/edit?usp=sharing) (updated periodically)
* [Reference Sheet from Upperline](https://github.com/upperlinecode/html-css-js-reference)

## Lessons
<!--(list each lesson with main topic(s))-->
Total lenght: 12 periods
* Lesson 1- Intro to Javascript. Look at sample JS projects
* Lesson 2- Intro to variables. Learn about variable and practice assigning variables.
* Lesson 3- Variables and conditionals. Use conditionals with variables.
* Lesson 4- Variables and window prompt. Using window prompt as an input.
* Lesson 5- innerHTML. Code a game of madlibs using window prompt as the input.
* Lesson 6- Inputs and events. Learn to use HTML inputs and through JS event listeners.
* Lesson 7- Project Mode. Students will choose and create one of 3 final projects.

TO DO LIST
- finish home page(assessments)
- write lesson plans(all slides done tho)
- rubrics for 3 final projects
- Add NY standards to your list of lessons for your unit plan.
- This is on the main overview page created from the unit plan template.
- After each lesson put the number of the standard(s) that apply.
