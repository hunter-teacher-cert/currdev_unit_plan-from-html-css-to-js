# Introduction to Javascript
by Daiana Munoz

-----

## General Overview
<!--(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)-->
Class: Digital Web Design

In this unit, students will learn the basics of Javascript and how it can be an interactive part of any website. By now, students will have learned HTML and CSS 
and will use both langugages throughout the unit. Students will learn about variables, DOM manipulation, and events. Final project will be done in pairs and can choose to code either Hangman, an Image Guesser, or a Quiz with a score at the end.

## Motivation for Unit
<!--(why have you decided to make this?)-->
Intro to Javascript will be the last unit in the Digital Web Design class taught at PEHS. JS is also a common language that front-end computer programmers use and I believe students should learn what is standard in the CS industry.

## Standards Referenced
<!--(select one of the standards sets reviewed in class (CSTA, NY, MA, RI), include a link and a brief explanation as to why you selected that set)-->
[New York State Computer Science and Digital Fluency Learning Standards(NYSCSDFLS)](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-digital-fluency-standards-k-12.pdf): I selected this set of standards because of its mmany sections which wee reflected in my lessons. I used some of the standards as inspiration during discusssions in class and while planning my work. Other standards didn't have as specific language to wat I wanted to teach.

## Tools Used
* HTML, CSS, and Javascript using Repl as the coding environment
* Google Classroom for access to the labs/assignments
  * Google Docs for planning their final project

## Resources
* [W3Schools](http://w3schools.com/)
* [Student Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Bj1zuknxTlWu1_b014lqL6UkduuS1iy1jdFcpv7hdYI/edit?usp=sharing) (updated periodically)
* [Reference Sheet from Upperline](https://github.com/upperlinecode/html-css-js-reference)

## Lessons
<!--(list each lesson with main topic(s))-->
Total lenght: 12 periods
* Lesson 1- Intro to Javascript. Look at sample JS projects
  * 9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.
* Lesson 2- Intro to variables. Learn about variables and practice assigning values.
  * 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.
* Lesson 3- Variables and conditionals. Use conditionals with variables.
  * 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.
* Lesson 4- Variables and window prompt. Using window prompt as an input.
  * 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.
  * 9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.
* Lesson 5- innerHTML. Code a game of madlibs using window prompt as the input.
  * 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.
* Lesson 6- Inputs and events. Learn to use HTML inputs and through JS event listeners.
  * 9-12.IC.4: Assess personal and societal trade-offs related to computing technologies and data privacy.
  * 9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.
  * 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.
  * 9-12.CY.1: Determine the types of personal and organizational information and digital resources that an individual may have access to that needs to be protected.
* Lesson 7- Project Mode. Students will choose and create one of 3 final projects.
  * 9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.
  * 9-12.IC.6: Create accessible computational artifacts that meet standard compliance requirements or otherwise meet the needs of users with disabilities.
  * 7-8.CT.6: Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program.
  * 7-8.CT.7: Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information.
  * 9-12.CT.9: Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.
  * 9-12.DL.2: Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

## Assessments
<!--(list summative and/or formative assessments used)-->
* Formative assessments:
  * all labs(in-class assignments/student activities) are graded informally and are based on completion of code-along work we did in class
  * homework as extension of labs

* Summative assessment:
  * Project 1- Students are expected to work with a partner and use a combination of the labs and the internet to create either an To Do List Creator, Hangman, or a Quiz with a score at the end. This will test their aability to use prior knowledge and fill in the gaps using online resources to finish the code.

TO DO LIST
- finish home page(assessments)
- write lesson plans(all slides done tho)
- rubrics for 3 final projects
- Develop An In Class And An Out Of Class Assignment For your unit plan. (fix these and add out of class one to one of the lessons (maybe final?))
